Without complex installation processes or heavy programs, you can experience moments of joy anytime, anywhere with just a browser. We believe accessibility is the beginning of enjoyment.\n\nModern life flows quickly. Short breaks during lunch, commute times, brief pauses between meetings.

        "title": "Creation Philosophy & Vision",
        "content": "We focus on creating 'moments of fun.' Rather than flashy graphics or complex systems, we prioritize intuitive controls and clear feedback that allow players to quickly immerse themselves. Under the belief that games should be rest, not burden, we pursue designs that anyone can understand and enjoy within five minutes.\n\nAccessibility and creativity don't oppose each other. Rather, we believe purer fun emerges from constraints. While acknowledging browser platform limitations, we experiment with physics engines, random algorithms, user customization, and more. Lightness and depth can coexist.\n\nIn 2025, the gaming industry grows increasingly heavy and complex. Dozens of gigabytes, high-spec graphics cards, paid subscription models. Yet many people still want simple, immediate fun. EasyPicky bridges this gap. Browser games aren't relics of the past—they're future choices prioritizing accessibility and convenience.\n\nOur vision is 'joy that starts with one click.' A platform where anyone can equally enjoy games regardless of language, region, or device. A culture where players customize games and create their own fun. EasyPicky isn't just a game site—it's a community sharing lightweight joy."

Add `*number` to set weights, e.g., `John Doe, Jane Smith*3, Bob*2`. Names can be up to 8 characters long. Higher weights mean more balls for that participant, increasing their chances of winning.\n\n**Select Map**: Choose from various custom maps beyond the default. Click the map selection button (🗺️) to open the map modal, where you can sort maps by name (A-Z), reverse name (Z-A), or creation date. Click a map card to preview and load it. Each map has different obstacle layouts and difficulty levels—try them all!\n\n**Winner Selection Mode**: Decide who wins when the game ends. Choose from First Place (highest score), Last Place (lowest score), Custom Rank (3rd, 5th, etc.), or Top N Places (multiple winners at once). Great for raffles or team games.\n\n**Speed Control**: Adjust game speed with the slider. Set between 0.1 (slow) and 0.5 (fast) across 5 levels, with 0.3 (normal) as default. Slow speed suits strategic play, while fast speed delivers intense gameplay.\n\n**Start and Reset**: Press 'Start' to drop balls from the top of the map, one per participant. During the game, check current rankings on the real-time leaderboard. When all balls reach the goal, the winner is announced, and you can choose 'Play Again' or 'Play Without Winner.' The 'Reset' button returns the game to its initial state.\n\n**Leaderboard and Minimap**: The top-right displays real-time rankings, while the top-left shows a minimap of the entire map. The minimap highlights the current camera view and ball paths, so you never lose track of the action on large maps.\n\n**Fullscreen Mode**: Click the fullscreen button (⛶) in the bottom-right for an immersive game environment.
