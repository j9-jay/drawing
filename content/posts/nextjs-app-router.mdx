# Next.js App Router: A Complete Guide

The App Router is a new paradigm in Next.js that brings powerful features and improved performance.

## Key Features

### Server Components

Server Components are the default in the App Router. They offer:

- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Direct database access
- Improved SEO
- Better performance

### File-based Routing

The App Router uses a file-system based routing where folders define routes:

```
app/
  layout.tsx
  page.tsx
  posts/
    page.tsx
    [slug]/
      page.tsx
```

## Metadata API

Generate dynamic metadata for SEO:

```typescript
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  return {
    title: 'My Page Title',
    description: 'My page description'
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use Server Components by default
2. Add `'use client'` only when needed
3. Leverage parallel and intercepting routes
4. Implement proper error boundaries

## Conclusion

The App Router represents the future of Next.js development. Start migrating your projects today!
